Overview
========

FishTracker is a GIS toolbox for kernel density estimation of animal home ranges that accounts for transit times and hard boundaries.  

The tool is described in Laffan & Taylor (2013) FishTracker: A GIS toolbox for kernel density estimation of animal home ranges that accounts for transit times and hard boundaries. In: 20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation. (Adelaide, Australia, 1–6 December 2013).  http://mssanz.org.au/modsim2013/H2/laffan.pdf

Timothy Spier from WIU has very kindly made two videos on the theory behind the tool and how to use it.  They can be accessed from http://youtu.be/3oq7I_9OkOw and http://youtu.be/G5R0vYTT9qA

For an example application, see Anastácio et al. (2015) Indicators of movement and space use for two co-occurring invasive crayfish species.  _Ecological Indicators_.   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.01.019
