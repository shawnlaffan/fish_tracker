FishTracker is a GIS toolbox for kernel density estimation of animal home ranges that accounts for transit times and hard boundaries.  

The tool is described in Laffan & Taylor (2013) FishTracker: A GIS toolbox for kernel density estimation of animal home ranges that accounts for transit times and hard boundaries. In: 20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation. (Adelaide, Australia, 1–6 December 2013).  [http://mssanz.org.au/modsim2013/H2/laffan.pdf][http://mssanz.org.au/modsim2013/H2/laffan.pdf]

Timothy Spier from WIU has very kindly made two videos on the theory behind the tool and how to use it.  They can be accessed from [http://youtu.be/3oq7I_9OkOw][http://youtu.be/3oq7I_9OkOw] and [http://youtu.be/G5R0vYTT9qA][http://youtu.be/G5R0vYTT9qA]
