FishTracker is a GIS toolbox for kernel density estimation of animal home ranges that accounts for transit times and hard boundaries.  

Timothy Spier from WIU has very kindly made two videos on the theory behind the tool and how to use it.  They can be accessed from http://youtu.be/3oq7I_9OkOw and http://youtu.be/G5R0vYTT9qA
